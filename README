Turkopticon helps workers on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform report and avoid shady employers ('requesters') by reviewing them on a third-party platform.

In turkopticon-dev, we attempt to refactor the existing codebase and introduce some new features to address a range of problems.

6 Load Error Workarounds

Error: On requiring ActionMailer,

  Gem::LoadError: can't activate rack (~> 1.2.1, runtime) for ["actionpack-3.0.9", "actionmailer-3.0.9"], already activated rack-1.3.0 for ["sinatra-1.2.6"]

Fix: In the actionpack gemspec, change '~>' to '>=' in the rack dependency,

  s.add_runtime_dependency(%q<rack>, [">= 1.2.1"])
